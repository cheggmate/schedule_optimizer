Please find below a brief overview of design and assumptions made:

Design:
1. First step was to run and parse info from the input text until an array,
2. to scan for duration and store data as array.
3. fit each event into the slots, once the next event is found, it is printed immediately in the format required.
4. once the end of day is reached, a new line is added.


Assumptions:
1. Total duration of events will be less than total available time of sessions.
2. Each session is provided in the following format: (Name of Event)(Space)(Time in minutes, with no space in between)
3. Each event in the text file is provided in a new line
4. There are no typo errors in the Events (e.g. "mins" is always spelt correctly)
5. Events of a similar topic need not be grouped together
